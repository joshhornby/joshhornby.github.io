A productive team means everyone must be busy at all times, right? 100% team utilisation is the goal and is the best way for us to hit our deadline.

The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a methodology for identifying the most important limiting factor (ie, constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal.

TOC tells us that attempting to keep everyone working at 100% creates hidden queues, excessive work-in-process, and longer lead times because non blocked work pules up in front of the actual constraint.

By contrast, system optimisation asks, "Does this action increase the team's overall throughput?" even if that means some people are temporarily idle.

Why individual "efficiency" can harm the whole

Practical techniques to optimise the team

- Make the constraint visible – value-stream mapping, Kanban boards with explicit WIP limits, flow-based metrics (lead time, throughput).

- Buffer intelligently – keep a small, controlled queue before the constraint to absorb variation, never a mountain of work.

- Cross-skill and pair – shift spare capacity to assist the bottleneck (e.g. developers help with automated tests).

- Short feedback loops – continuous integration and small batch sizes reduce variability hitting the constraint.

- Throughput-based KPIs – measure value delivered per sprint or per week, not hours booked.

Cultural implications

- Psychological safety to slow down: Team members must feel safe to stop starting and start finishing.
- Shared responsibility: Work is “done” only when the whole stream is complete; bragging about personal velocity becomes irrelevant.

- Leadership focus: Managers coach the team to protect and elevate the bottleneck instead of rewarding individual utilisation.

In summary, TOC reframes optimisation from "keeping everyone busy" to maximising the flow of value through the one place that governs throughput. A team that thinks and acts this way outperforms any collection of hyper-optimised individuals.
