One of the most important relationships for a Tech Lead is with their product manager. A strong partnership here can make or break a team's success.

In this post I share some principles and practices I've found useful when working closely with product managers.

## What Product Managers Do

I think it's useful to start by understanding the role of a product manager. In my experience, a PM is responsible for:

- Defining the product vision and strategy
- Prioritising features and roadmap items based on customer needs and business goals
- Collaborating with stakeholders across the business
- Representing the customer within the team

This sometimes gets boiled down to PMs focus on the "what" and "why" of product development, while engineering focus on the "how".

The delivery role of PMs can vary significantly between organisations. In some companies, PMs are deeply involved in day-to-day delivery, while in others they take a more strategic view. In my experience engineering normally own delivery execution, with PMs providing context, prioritisation, and stakeholder management.

## Owning the How, Partnering on the What

I see the Tech Lead owning the "how" of delivery - ensuring we build things the right way, with quality and maintainability in mind. However, I also see value in partnering closely with PMs on the "what" - understanding the customer needs and business goals behind features.

In my experience it's not uncommon for the PM to be more junior than the Tech Lead in terms of experience. In these situations, I see part of the Tech Lead role as mentoring and supporting the PM to grow into their role. This could involve sharing best practices around prioritisation, stakeholder management, or customer research.

## Balancing Delivery and Quality

A common situation Tech Leads face is balancing the need for speedy delivery with maintaining high quality. PMs may push for faster delivery to meet business deadlines, while engineers advocate for more time to ensure quality. In these situations, open communication is key.

Like most things in product engineering, it's about finding the right balance. Sometimes speed is more important, while other times quality must take precedence. By discussing trade-offs openly, we can make informed decisions together.

A good practice I've found is to involve PMs in technical discussions about architecture and quality. This helps them understand the implications of technical decisions on delivery timelines.

## Common Challenges

Over the years I've seen a few common challenges arise in the PM-Engineering relationship:

Expand each of these

- **Misaligned priorities.** Sometimes PMs focus on short-term delivery at the expense of technical quality. It's important to have open conversations about balancing speed with maintainability.
- **Lack of clarity on roles.** When it's unclear who owns what, things can fall through the cracks. Defining responsibilities upfront helps avoid confusion.
- **Different perspectives on success.** PMs may prioritise business metrics, while engineers focus on technical excellence. Finding common ground is essential.
