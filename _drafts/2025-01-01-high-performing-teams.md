I've been re-reading Empowered by Marty Cagan, and this quote stuck with me:

> "The three critical characteristics of product teams, no matter what processes they use: the first is tackling risks early; the second is solving problems collaboratively; and the third is being accountable to results"

Cagan is talking here about Product Engineering teams, but I think this also applies to leaders of Engineering teams, Tech Lead, Team Lead, Engineering Manager, etc.
.
