I've been using GitHub Copilot lately. It's... fine. It's not bad, it's not great. Sometimes it autocompletes the boilerplate I didn't want to write. Sometimes it gets in the way, guessing wrong. The Copilot agent which runs in the background and creates PR's is promising. Overall, it feels like a marginal gain, not a revolution. Copilot is clever enough to keep around, but nowhere near game-changing.

And that's the strange part. GitHub is core to how I (and just about everyone else I know) build software. They had a chance to own this AI space, every repo, every workflow, every developer already in their ecosystem. Microsoft's money, Microsoft's reach, the infrastructure to ship to millions with a single update. They had the first mover advantage, but 
didn't capitalise on it.

Copilot stalled. At least, that's how it feels in day-to-day use. The excitement of those first autocompleted blocks wore off quickly. After a year, the product feels incremental. Some UX polish, more supported languages, better at suggesting what you already know. It's an improvement by inches, not by leaps.

The bigger picture? I'm sure Copilot is evolving behind the scenes; maybe there's a grand vision in the roadmap. But from where I'm sitting using the product, talking to other engineers, following the announcements, the story is steady, not explosive. Copilot is convenient, sometimes helpful, but it doesn't feel like it's breaking new ground. AI, yes. Revolutionary, no.

Meanwhile, the real interesting stuff, the stuff that actually changes how you write, ship, and reason about software, [started](https://windsurf.com/) [popping](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) [up](https://lovable.dev/) [elsewhere](https://www.cursor.com/en). Whole workflows are rebuilt from the ground up, agentic tools that don't just suggest lines but re-architect whole files.

All of this leaves me wondering if GitHub's moment to redefine how we build software with AI has quietly passed, while the real breakthroughs are happening everywhere but GitHub.
