Ideas for the [Tech Leadership Series](/tags/tech-lead-series/).

What is a tech lead?

## Relationships

- **Working with Designers** - Similar dynamic to PMs. When to push back on designs, how to collaborate early, handling "pixel perfect" vs pragmatism.
- **Working with Other Tech Leads** - Cross-team dependencies, aligning on standards, avoiding turf wars.
- **Managing Up** - Keeping your EM informed, advocating for your team, influencing without authority.

## Team Building

- **Onboarding Engineers** - First week, first month, first quarter. What actually helps people ramp up vs what's just process theatre.
- **Running Effective 1:1s** - As a tech lead, not a manager. Career conversations, technical mentoring, spotting disengagement early.
- **Building Technical Culture** - Code review norms, documentation habits, knowledge sharing. How these emerge from small repeated actions.
- **Mentoring Without Micromanaging** - When to pair, when to let them struggle, when to just take over.

## Delivery

- **Balancing Coding and Leading** - The hardest transition. How much IC work is too much? How little is too little?
- **Scope Creep and How to Fight It** - Recognising it early, having the conversation, protecting the team.
- **Running Ceremonies That Don't Waste Time** - Standups, retros, planning. What to keep, what to kill, what to change.
- **When to Say No** - To PMs, to stakeholders, to your own team. The skill nobody teaches.

## Technical Leadership

- **Making Technical Decisions Stick** - ADRs, RFCs, or just conversations? How to decide and how to document.
- **Handling Incidents** - Your role during and after. Blameless postmortems that actually improve things.
- **Managing Technical Debt** - Framing it for non-technical stakeholders, prioritising it, tracking progress.
- **Code Review as a Leadership Tool** - Setting standards, teaching through feedback, avoiding bottlenecks.

## Career

- **The Tech Lead Trap** - When the role becomes a dead end. How to keep growing.
- **Tech Lead vs Engineering Manager** - The fork in the road. How to decide.
- **Your First 90 Days as Tech Lead** - What to focus on, what to ignore, common mistakes.

## Tough Conversations

- **Giving Hard Feedback** - Performance issues, attitude problems, skill gaps. How to be direct without being cruel.
- **Inheriting a Struggling Team** - Low morale, tech debt, unclear direction. Where to start.
- **When Someone Needs to Leave** - Recognising it, escalating it, handling the aftermath.
