I believe "Systems thinking" is about interactions rather than silos.
Translating this to software development, it's important for developers to interact with QA, Project Management and DevOps.

In order to apply "Systems thinking" we should be able to communicate with people from Dev, Ops and QA, listen to them, understand their problems and find ways to let them work together instead of getting a "through it over the wall" mentality and unconnected departments in the company.
