!! Reframe this as working backwards, using leading and lagging indicators, and focusing on the outcomes that matter to the business.

There's a particular feeling you get when the roadmap arrives, fully baked, from on high. Leadership spend weeks debating strategy; you get an email and a deck. By the time you see the plan, the initiatives and deadlines are set in stone. Your job, mostly, is to execute.

When outcome measurement lands in this sort of environment, it can feel cosmetic. The language changes suddenly it's all about "outcomes" and "impact", but the reality doesn't. Teams don't really own the goals; the only thing that's changed is the format of the status updates. At best, you're reframing a list of tasks as outcomes. No surprise that people get cynical.

The underlying reason this feels hollow comes down to incentives. [Most teams respond to what gets celebrated and rewarded](/culture-follows-incentives). If the organisation still values delivering initiatives over moving the business, measuring outcomes quickly becomes just another ritual, a layer of process that leaves the underlying priorities untouched.

It's easy for measurement to turn into theatre. Outcomes are handed down, metrics become the numbers that matter to someone higher up. There's a ritual of writing, reviewing, and updating, but nobody expects that any of this will change what happens on the ground. You end up tracking numbers for the dashboard, not because you expect it'll shape real decisions.

This is where process reality diverges from process intent. The lived process is always the one people experience day to day, not what's written in the handbook. If the unspoken rule is "just say yes to the boss", it won't matter how you phrase the outcomes, they'll serve as another compliance checklist rather than an engine for healthy challenge.

But there is a subtle, structural value that comes with measuring outcomes, even in a top-down shop: metrics force conversations that wouldn't otherwise happen. When you're required to put a number on a goal, it brings trade-offs and priorities to the surface. Teams suddenly have to answer: what does success really look like? Is moving this number from X to Y meaningful, or are we just pushing a rock up the same hill?

This isn't a cure-all, but it does create leverage. Even when the work is dictated, a measurable outcome gives teams a reason to interrogate the plan: is this project actually going to move the metric, or should we be prioritising something else? The discussion becomes less about how many things get shipped and more about whether anything actually changes.

Friction here is a healthy sign. When outcome measures provoke debate, disagreement, or even discomfort, it means the process is surfacing genuine trade-offs, not just generating reporting noise. The system is adjusting. This tension should be encouraged, not as conflict for its own sake, but as a signal that the team is engaged in real prioritisation, not passive delivery.

For any of this to work, teams need actual slack, room to think critically and challenge the status quo. If every quarter is a scramble to keep up, nobody's going to step back and question the plan. Measurement is just extra pressure, not a platform for smarter work.

None of this shifts overnight. If you're working in a command-and-control org, you're not going to suddenly get a blank slate. But you can start using measurement to force better conversations:

- Tie every initiative to a business metric, no task-based measures, only real, observable outcomes.
- Treat measurement as a tool to ask, "Is this work actually moving our numbers?" Don't let status updates crowd out honest prioritisation.
- Use regular check-ins to talk trade-offs, not just progress. Where are you spending time that isn't shifting the needle? What's worth dropping or doubling down?
- Recognise teams that use outcome measurement to cut low-impact projects, not just those who deliver on every target.

The point isn't that tracking outcomes will fix a top-down culture. But it can make the gap between activity and impact more visible. If you treat measurement as a lever, not a box-ticking exercise, it can help shift the conversation from "just do it" to "what's actually worth doing?" That's not compliance, it's the foundation of a healthier, more outcome-driven way of working.
