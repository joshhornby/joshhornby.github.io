One of the most important relationships for a Tech Lead is with their product manager. A strong partnership here can make or break a team's success.

## What Product Managers Do

It's useful to start by understanding the role of a product manager. A PM is responsible for:

- Product vision and strategy
- Prioritisation based on customer needs and business goals
- Stakeholder relationships across the business
- Representing the customer within the team

This can be shortened to: PMs focus on the "what" and "why", engineering focuses on the "how".

Often the delivery role is overlooked and it can vary significantly between organisations. In some companies, PMs are deeply involved in day-to-day delivery, while in others they take a more strategic view. In my experience engineering normally own delivery execution, with PMs providing context, prioritisation, and stakeholder management.

## Owning the How, Partnering on the What

The Tech Lead owns the "how" - ensuring we build things the right way, with quality and maintainability in mind. But stopping there is a mistake, Tech Leads also engage with the "what" - understanding customer needs and business goals behind features. This isn't stepping on the PM's toes. It's how you catch problems early and propose solutions that actually fit.

This matters even more when the PM is less experienced. Tech Leads often have years on their PM counterparts, especially at growing companies. Use that. Share what you've learned about prioritisation, stakeholder management, or customer research. A stronger PM makes your life easier.

## Balancing Delivery and Quality

A common situation Tech Leads face is balancing the need for speedy delivery with maintaining high quality. PMs may push for faster delivery to meet business deadlines, while engineers advocate for more time to ensure quality. In these situations, open communication is key.

The answer isn't to pick a side. It's to make the trade-offs explicit. Sometimes speed wins. Sometimes quality must. What matters is deciding together with eyes open.

One thing that helps: bring PMs into technical discussions about architecture and quality. When they understand why something takes longer, the conversations get easier.

## Common Challenges

Over the years I've seen a few common challenges arise in the PM-Engineering relationship:

### Unclear ownership

When nobody knows who owns what, things slip through. The PM assumes engineering will handle stakeholder updates. Engineering assumes the PM has it covered. Neither does. The fix is boring but effective: define responsibilities early. Write them down. Revisit them when scope changes.

### Different definitions of success

PMs watch business metrics. Engineers care about technical excellence. Neither is wrong, but without shared goals you end up talking past each other. The PM celebrates a feature launch while the engineer winces at the shortcuts taken to hit the deadline. Align on what "done well" looks like before you start, not after.

### Committing to dates without engineering input

PM promises a deadline to stakeholders, then tells the team. Engineers feel set up to fail before they've written a line of code. The fix: bring engineering into estimation conversations before commitments are made. Even a rough "t-shirt size" check can prevent a lot of pain. I've written more about this in [Estimation Pragmatism](/estimation-pragmatism).

### Solution vs problem framing

PM arrives with a fully-specced solution instead of a problem to solve. Engineers become ticket-takers rather than partners. Better PMs share the customer problem and constraints, then collaborate on the approach. The best solutions often come from engineers who understand the technical possibilities. This is what [Product Engineers](/product-engineers) do well.

### Technical work as a hard sell

Refactoring, paying down debt, improving observability. PMs don't always see the value because it doesn't move a business metric. The relationship gets strained when engineers feel they have to constantly justify foundational work. Frame technical investments in terms of what they enable: faster future delivery, fewer incidents, less firefighting.

### "Just a small change"

PM assumes something is easy because it sounds simple. A one-line copy change turns into a database migration. Trust erodes when engineers feel their expertise isn't respected. The antidote is curiosity: ask why something is complex instead of assuming it shouldn't be.

## The Relationship Is the Work

Most of these challenges come down to the same thing: two people with different contexts trying to solve the same problem. The PM sees stakeholder pressure, market timing, and customer feedback you'll never hear. You see technical risk, maintenance burden, and the last three times a "quick fix" came back to bite you.

Neither view is complete. The best PM-Tech Lead partnerships I've seen treat this gap as a feature, not a bug. You're not supposed to agree on everything. You're supposed to bring different perspectives and hash it out until you land on something better than either of you would reach alone.

That takes trust. Trust takes time. And time takes showing up, being honest about trade-offs, and occasionally admitting you got it wrong.
