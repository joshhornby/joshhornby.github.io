For years, I was an estimation sceptic, closed off to the idea of using it. I saw estimation as a relic of a past era, something best left to Gantt charts and process-heavy project managers. Agile, I thought, had saved us from the shackles of story points, T-shirt sizes, and man-hour breakdowns. Why play the planning poker game at all if the future's always going to surprise us?

It's hard to talk about estimation without baggage. There's the meeting that turns into a three-hour debate over T-shirt sizes, the line manager who weaponises story points, the well-intentioned agile transformation that quietly slides into velocity theatre. It's tempting to swing hard in the other direction, "Estimation is broken, let's just build and see what happens". I've been there. I even believed it for a while.

But the thing is: businesses don't run on blind faith. Budgets exist, customers have deadlines, and the rest of the company isn't waiting around for engineering to reach nirvana. In the absence of any signal, trust erodes fast. So, estimation remains not as a magic trick, but as a tool for alignment.

What's shifted for me is how I see the role of estimation. The mistakes aren't hard to spot: using estimates as a play for control, pinning commitments to numbers we all know are uncertain, letting metrics stand in for real conversations. That's when things get toxic, when estimates become a stick, not a bridge.

But estimation can be quieter, more useful. At its best, it's not a contract, it's an early warning, a sketch of uncertainty, a starting point for conversation. It gives the business something to work with, lets customers plan, and maybe most importantly, signals that engineering is part of the team, not a black box. The job isn't to produce perfect numbers; it's to reduce surprise.

And that's the part I missed: good estimation is about de-risking, not pretending to know the future. An estimate highlights the areas that might blow up, surfaces the dependencies, and draws out the parts that need more thinking. By exposing where we're unsure, we can focus our energy prototyping, spiking, slicing work smaller, before those risks turn into blockers downstream. Estimation, when used well, shines a light on uncertainty before it becomes an emergency.

I don't think there's one right way to do this. T-shirt sizes, story points, a ballpark "next quarter" it all depends on the context. The teams I trust most treat estimation as just another means of dialogue, a way to keep the partnership with the rest of the company healthy and open. They're up front about uncertainty, clear on trade-offs, and quick to adapt when the situation changes. That's the kind of pragmatism that actually survives contact with the real world.

Estimation isn't about control, and it isn't about purity. It's about partnership. The rest is just detail.
