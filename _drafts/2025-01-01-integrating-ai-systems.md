Every company is looking to pick an AI platform right now. You get endless demo calls, benchmarks, and new "best models" every few months. It's easy to get caught up comparing all the latest scores.

But the "best" model is always temporary. What actually matters is how well the platform fits into the way your team already works. That's what sticks.

We should've learned this from the SaaS years. Back then, we kept adding new tools for every problem, suddenly you're drowning in logins, dashboards, and clunky hand-offs between systems. Each tool on its own made sense, but stitching it all together turned into a real challenge.

With AI, the risk is even bigger. The best models will keep changing, probably faster than any tool you've used before. But if your platform plugs cleanly into your existing tools, sign-in, security, workflow, you can swap out the model later, without forcing everyone to relearn their job.

That's the lesson: it's not about chasing the most powerful model every quarter. It's about making sure your AI platform feels invisible, working quietly in the background, integrated with what you already have. The easier it fits, the less it matters when the technology changes.

So if you're making a decision now, look beyond the benchmarks. Ask yourself: Will this fit my team's day-to-day? Can I swap out the model without a huge rebuild? How much work will it take to plug in?

Because models will always change, but your integration work will stick around much longer.
