In software development quality is like a symphony, while each section of the orchestra focuses on their own part, true excellence only emerges when all elements come together. Product managers might see quality through the lens of user satisfaction and bug counts, while engineers view it through code maintainability and system reliability. These differing perspectives frequently lead to misalignment and friction within teams.

## The Quality Perception Gap

When product teams ask, "Why do we have more bugs?" they're often looking at quality through metrics like:

- User-reported issues
- Feature completeness
- Customer satisfaction scores
- App store ratings
- Support ticket volume

Meanwhile, engineering teams are considering:

- Code coverage percentages
- System uptime
- Response latency
- Technical debt measurements
- Code maintainability scores

This disconnect isn't just semantic, it reflects fundamentally different ways of thinking about and measuring quality.

## Weinberg's Quality Frameworks

Gerald Weinberg's work on software quality provides a valuable framework for understanding these different perspectives. He identified five distinct ways people view quality:

1. **Transcendent Quality**: The "I know it when I see it" perspective. This intuitive view of quality is common among experienced practitioners but challenging to quantify or standardise.
2. **User-based Quality**: Focuses on fitness for purpose - does the software do what users need it to do? This aligns closely with product management's typical view.
3. **Manufacturing-based Quality**: Emphasises conformance to specifications. Engineers often gravitate toward this view, as it provides clear, measurable standards.
4. **Product-based Quality**: Links quality to inherent characteristics of the software itself, like performance or reliability.
5. **Value-based Quality**: Balances benefits against costs, considering quality in terms of return on investment.

## Bridging the Divide

To align these different perspectives, teams need to:

### 1. Create Shared Quality Metrics

Develop metrics that matter to both groups. For example:

- Time to resolve critical issues
- User-impacting incident frequency
- Feature adoption rates
- [Technical debt impact on delivery speed](/reconsidering-tech-debt)

### 2. Establish Cross-functional Quality Reviews

Regular quality reviews should include both technical and product perspectives. These sessions can help teams:

- Share different quality concerns
- Understand trade-offs
- Align on priorities
- Build shared context

### 3. Develop a Common Language

Create a shared vocabulary around quality that bridges technical and product concerns. This might include:

- Clear definitions of what constitutes a bug vs a feature request
- Agreed-upon severity levels
- Common success criteria for releases
- Shared quality objectives

### 4. Use Data-Driven Discussions

Move beyond subjective feelings about quality by:

- Tracking trends over time
- Setting measurable quality goals
- Using objective metrics for decision-making
- Conducting regular quality retrospectives

## Moving Forward

Quality isn't one-dimensional, and treating it as such does a disservice to both product and engineering teams. By understanding and embracing different quality perspectives, teams can build more robust approaches to quality management.

The key is not to force everyone into the same view of quality, but to create frameworks that acknowledge and incorporate different perspectives. This might mean having multiple sets of quality metrics, or different quality reviews for different aspects of the system.

Remember that quality is a journey, not a destination. As your product evolves, so too should your approach to quality. Regular reassessment of quality metrics and goals ensures they remain relevant and valuable to all stakeholders.

By acknowledging these different perspectives and creating systems that account for them, teams can build better software while maintaining healthy relationships between product and engineering teams.
