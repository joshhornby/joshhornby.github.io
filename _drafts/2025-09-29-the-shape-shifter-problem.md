I wrote before about [pioneers, settlers, and town planners](/pioneers-settlers-and-town-planners), how different people fit different phases of product development. Dimitri Glazkov's piece on [sailors and pirates](https://glazkov.com/2023/04/02/sailors-and-pirates/) explores similar territory, looking at the tension between structure and improvisation. Both frameworks assume people can shift between roles when needed.

What neither captures are the hidden cost of that shifting.

**Each mode switch isn't just a context change. It's a complete rewiring of how you think about problems.**

When you're pioneering, you suppress the voice that worries about edge cases and technical debt. You move fast and accept that things will break. When you're planning, you flip that entirely: you think through failure modes, consider maintainability, design for scale. These aren't just different skills, they're opposing mental models.

Most engineers can do both. The problem is the transition cost. It takes time to get into pioneer mode and start taking the right kinds of risks. It takes even longer to shift into planner mode and start seeing the systems implications of every decision. Force someone to flip between these and they'll deliver poorly in both.

Yet that's exactly what most organisations do. We see versatility as an unlimited resource and context-switching as free. The same person who spends Monday morning sketching out a new feature gets pulled into an architecture review that afternoon, then asked to debug a production issue before close of play. Each task might take two hours, but the switching overhead means they're exhausted and nothing gets proper attention.

**The real cost isn't the time between tasks. It's the degraded quality of work when your brain is still in the wrong gear.**

I've watched engineers burn out not from overwork but from this constant gear grinding. They know they could do each thing well if given the space to settle into the right mindset, but instead they're always operating at partial capacity.

The organisations that get this right don't try to eliminate mode-switching, they just batch it intelligently. Dedicate mornings to prototyping, afternoons to refactoring. Run pioneer sprints and planner sprints rather than mixing them daily. Give people permission to say "I'm in the wrong headspace for this right now" without it being seen as inflexibility.

Most of the time when we talk about engineer productivity, we focus on tools and processes. Maybe the bigger lever is just letting people finish one kind of thinking before we ask them to start another.
