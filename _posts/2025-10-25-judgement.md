I've been thinking about the relationship between experience and judgement. Initially, I assumed that accumulating experience would naturally lead to better judgement. After all, the more situations you encounter, the more patterns you should recognise, right?

But for that to be true, you need to actively reflect on your experiences. Without reflection, experiences are just a series of events that happen without deeper understanding.

I'm trying two things to improve my judgement, the first is keeping a decision log. After major choices, write down the reasoning and expected outcomes. Revisit these decisions later and compare the outcomes vs assumptions.

The second is to teach others. Explaining your reasoning to someone else forces you to clarify your own thinking. It also exposes gaps in your understanding.
