For Staff and Principal Engineers, the goal is to identify and deliver leveraged work, efforts that multiply both throughput and quality across the organisation.

Picture leverage as a chart: time on the x-axis, impact on the y. The goal is top-right: work that lasts years and touches everything. Not quick boosts or flashy results, but work that compounds. Work that becomes foundation, shifts how teams think, makes everyone better.

| If it...                                                  | ...then it probably belongs in that sweet-spot |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| keeps paying dividends long after the launch              | Longevity is doing the heavy lifting           |
| turns one hour of effort into many hours saved for others | Non-linear impact is showing up                |
| lets teams build *on* it rather than *around* it          | clear Enablement                               |
| leaves a template, script, or doc that's easy to copy     | strong Teachability                            |

Finding leveraged work is mostly detective work. Talk to teams, read between the lines, spot the patterns. 

- **Pain-point mapping**: Sit with on-call, read incident reviews, spot recurring toil
- **Roadmap stress-tests**: "What single failure would torpedo next year?" Fix that first
- **Glue-work synthesis**: Connect patterns across teams into shared libraries or services

Below are some concrete examples of leveraged work:

- **Feature-flag platform**: Internal service and SDKs for fast, reversible releases
- **Incident retrospective programme**: Lightweight 5-Whys process targeting systemic fixes
- **Service bootstrap template**: Generator that creates production-ready apps in minutes

Leveraged work is how Staff and Principal engineers multiply impact as it's durable, scales beyond the individual, and spreads by design.
