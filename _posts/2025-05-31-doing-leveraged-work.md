For Staff and Principal Engineers, the goal is to identify and deliver leveraged work, efforts that multiply both throughput and quality across the organisation.

Picture leverage as a simple chart: time on the x-axis, impact on the y. The real win is top right contributions that endure and change the trajectory. Not just a quick boost or flashy result, but work that compounds. It becomes part of the foundation others build on, shifts the baseline, and raises the bar for everything that follows.

| If it...                                                  | ...then it probably belongs in that sweet-spot |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| keeps paying dividends long after the launch              | Longevity is doing the heavy lifting           |
| turns one hour of effort into many hours saved for others | Non-linear impact is showing up                |
| lets teams build *on* it rather than *around* it          | clear Enablement                               |
| leaves a template, script, or doc that's easy to copy     | strong Teachability                            |

The art of leveraged work is finding where the opportunities lie, the majority of the time these can be found through conversations with team members and the wider business. 

- **Pain-point mapping**: Sit with on-call, read incident reviews, notice recurring toil
- **Road-map stress-tests**: Ask, "What single failure would torpedo next year's plan?" and front-load the fix
- **Glue-work synthesis**: Connect patterns observed across teams and turn them into shared libraries or services

Below are some concrete examples of leveraged work:

- **Feature-flag platform**: Internal service + SDKs for fast, reversible releases
- **Incident-retrospective programme**: A lightweight 5-Whys process that looks at systemic fixes
- **Service-bootstrap template**: A generator that spins up a production-ready app in minutes

Leveraged work is how Staff & Principal engineers multiply impact as it's durable, scales beyond the individual, and spreads by design.
