For Staff and Principal Engineers the goal is to identify and deliver leveraged work, efforts that multiply both throughput and quality across the organisation.

Think of leverage as a two-axis graph: **longevity** runs left-to-right; **impact curve** climbs bottom-to-top. The sweet-spot is the top-right, ideas that stick around *and* push the output curve upwards.

| If it...                                                  | ...then it probably belongs in that sweet-spot |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| keeps paying dividends long after the launch              | Longevity is doing the heavy lifting           |
| turns one hour of effort into many hours saved for others | Non-linear impact is showing up                |
| lets teams build *on* it rather than *around* it          | clear Enablement                               |
| leaves a template, script, or doc that’s easy to copy     | strong Teachability                            |

When an idea lands two or more of those signals, odds are it’s worth chasing.

The art of leveraged work if finding where the opportunities lie, the majority of the time these can be found through conversations with team members and the wider business. 

- **Pain-point mapping** - sit with on-call, read incident reviews, notice recurring toil
- **Road-map stress-tests** - ask, “What single failure would torpedo next year’s plan?” and front-load the fix
- **Glue-work synthesis** - connect patterns observed across teams and turn them into shared libraries or services

Below are some concrete examples of leveraged work:

- **Feature-flag platform** - internal service + SDKs for fast, reversible releases
- **Incident-retrospective programme** - a lightweight 5-Whys process that looks at systemic fixes
- **Service-bootstrap template** - a generator that spins up a production-ready app in minutes

Leveraged work is the Staff+ engineer’s force-multiplier: durable, non-linear in impact, and contagious by design.
