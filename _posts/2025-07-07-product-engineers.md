In teams that consistently deliver real customer value, there's almost always an engineer who thinks beyond the code. They focus on outcomes, not just output. Their impact is usually obvious, even if it’s not loudly stated.

**Product Engineers focus on outcomes**. They don't measure success in tickets closed, lines written, or perfect abstractions. Their goal is customer impact. They're the ones who push a fix to unblock a customer, ask uncomfortable questions about whether a feature is worth building, and shorten the loop between idea and result. Their habit is to care about what happens after the merge, not just that something is deployed to production.

From a leadership perspective, these engineers are catalysts. They make the impact visible, close the gap between what we ship and what actually changes for the customer. And when one person shows these traits, it spreads. Priorities get sharper, feedback loops tighten, and the team starts delivering value that shows up outside the Jira board.

## Product Engineering is an Outcome Mindset

In most orgs, it's easy to slip into the habit of measuring success by output: shipping features, reducing cycle time, moving tickets from "in progress" to "done". But more output doesn't guarantee outcomes. Shipping alone doesn't create value.

Product Engineers resist these patterns. They work to close the gap between "what was asked for" and "what actually helps". They make a habit of seeking real feedback. They're comfortable with ambiguity, happy to prototype, adjust, or change tack when the data points somewhere new. Most of their work is invisible: aligning context, nudging decisions, refining what "done" really means.

When you have Product Engineers on a team, you notice things start to move differently:

- Customer problems actually get solved, not just acknowledged
- Solutions fit the shape of the need, not just the spec
- [Feedback loops tighten](/optimising-teams-with-theory-of-constraints), learning happens faster
- The boundary between engineering and product blurs, in the best possible way

The result? Fewer long hand-offs, less energy spent justifying the roadmap, more collective momentum. The team shifts from "are we building it right?" to "are we building the right thing?"

## What to Look For (and How to Support It)

Product Engineers aren't just technically strong they focus on real outcomes, are comfortable with uncertainty, and take ownership of an idea all the way to the user and back. That's what sets them apart.

Supporting Product Engineers means rewarding these habits. But it's more than praise or an annual review. It's about designing your system, so these behaviours are the default, not the exception. Here's how to make that real:

- **Make outcomes visible, not just output.** Highlight what changed for users, not just what shipped. In reviews, demos, or Slack shout‑outs, talk about the customer pain solved, or what actually got better, not the ticket count.

- **Create slack for exploration.** Protect time for small experiments, user spikes, or hack weeks. Let engineers test and learn, not just deliver against a fixed backlog. If you only measure velocity, you'll never get new ideas.

- **Default to transparency.** Give engineers a direct line to customer feedback, support tickets, and usage data. Don't hide the raw story, let them see what's working and what's not.

- **Give permission to cross silos.** Encourage engineers who jump into product, support, or design conversations to move the work forward. When someone crosses a boundary to unblock a customer, treat it as impact, not distraction.

- **Reward the full loop, not just the launch.** Celebrate the people who follow the work after release, close the loop with users, and learn from what didn't land. The best outcomes show up after the sprint's over.

- **Tolerate (smart) failures.** Make room for prototypes that don't ship, or experiments that fizzle. If you punish every dead end, you'll only get safe, incremental work.

- **Align recognition and progression.** Promotions, bonuses, and praise should reflect these habits. If the only path up is heroics, velocity, or sticking to your lane, don't expect anyone to own the messy, [high‑leverage work](/doing-leveraged-work).

- **Give explicit feedback.** When someone shows bias to outcomes, closes the loop, or builds cross‑team empathy, call it out. Make it clear this is the bar.

Supporting Product Engineers is about system design, not cheerleading. Culture follows incentives, and if you want more outcomes, you need to make it safer, easier, and more rewarding to get close to customers, own the loop, and measure what changes, not just what ships.
