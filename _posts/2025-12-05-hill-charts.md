If a picture speaks a thousand words. A hill chart shows where we got stuck explaining them. 

I've found Hill Charts helpful for visualising progress, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Instead of just marking tasks as "not started", "in progress", or "done", Hill Charts show where you actually are in figuring something out.

## What are Hill Charts?

Hill Charts are a visual tool used to track the progress of tasks or projects. They represent the journey from uncertainty to clarity, helping teams understand where they are in the process of completing a task.

## How Hill Charts Work

Hill Charts consist of a hill shape, with the left side representing the "uphill" phase where uncertainty is high and the right side representing the "downhill" phase where clarity increases. The peak of the hill signifies the point where the team has enough information to proceed confidently.

Teams plot their tasks on the hill based on their current understanding and progress. As they gather more information and make decisions, they move the task along the hill.

The drawback is that Hill Charts can be subjective. They rely on people's own sense of where they are. Regular check-ins help, so the team agrees on what moving up or down the hill actually means.

I've found Hill Charts particularly useful when communicating with senior stakeholders. They provide a clear visual representation of progress and help manage expectations around uncertainty and risk. 

Next time you're tracking a project with unknowns, consider using a Hill Chart to visualise your progress.
