I had originally written this post expressing my disappointment at GitHub Copilot, that post can be summed up with by paragraph:

_GitHub is core to how I (and just about everyone else I know) build software. They had a chance to own this AI space, every repo, every workflow, every developer already in their ecosystem. Microsoft's money, Microsoft's reach, the infrastructure to ship to millions with a single update. They had the first mover advantage, but
didn't capitalise on it._

But since trying [Copilot Coding Agent](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/) my opinion has changed.

Why? Because this time, it actually feels like a leap, not a minor update. The agent isn't just helping with snippets or boilerplate, it's chaining actions, holding context, and offering real, end-to-end support across a whole task. It feels less like autocomplete and more like a reliable partner, something that can actually carry a thread from start to finish, rather than just popping in with a guess and vanishing.

It feels like the gap between "tool" and "partner" is shrinking fast. The AI is only going to get smarter, more integrated, and more opinionated. Some tasks that used to take a whole afternoon are now done before you've finished your coffee.

Who knows what a team even looks like a year from now? Maybe it's a mix of humans and agents, handing work back and forth. Maybe the "typical" team of 1 PM, 1 UX, and 5 engineers isn't so typical for long. If the agent keeps getting smarter _(which it will)_, the shape of the team shifts too. Maybe it's fewer people spending more time on what matters, or maybe new roles appear that we can't even describe yet.

It feels like the start of another shift in how teams work. Less time on glue, more time on real product. Less friction, fewer repetitive tasks, and a lot more focus on what only humans can do.
