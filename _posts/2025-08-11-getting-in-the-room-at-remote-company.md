If you want to influence decisions, steer strategy, or just be in the loop on the conversations that matter there's no shortcut: you need to get in the room. The challenge in a remote company is that "the room" isn't always visible. There's no obvious boardroom or after‑work drinks; instead, it's a patchwork of private Slack channels, half‑hidden docs, and recurring calls where the real work happens. And by the time you realise the meeting took place, the decision's usually already been made.

The door isn't locked, but it's not exactly wide open either. So, how do you earn a seat and keep it, without coming across as the person constantly chasing an invite?

## Getting in the room

It starts with knowing which room you're trying to get into. Remote companies are full of spaces that look important, big meetings, high‑traffic channels, all‑hands but most high‑impact decisions get made in smaller, faster‑moving groups. These tend to form around critical projects, not titles. The trick is to notice where blockers are surfacing and where people are spending their energy. That's usually where the real decisions are made.

When you're aiming for a seat, don't show up empty‑handed. The people already in the room have little patience for spectators. You need to bring something valuable: a concrete solution to a tricky problem, fresh data, or insight from the edge of the business nobody else is seeing. People rarely remember who was in the meeting, but they remember who brought the missing piece.

In remote settings, written work matters more than ever. The best way to get noticed isn't to talk the most in meetings; it's to leave a clear trail of crisp, useful documents. A tight summary that helps the team move forward will get you invited back faster than a hundred status updates.

But all of this only works if you build relationships. In the office, you could rely on bumping into people, but in a distributed team, you need to be more deliberate. Reach out for short catch‑ups, share context, and crucially follow through when you say you will. Quiet reliability is a better door‑opener than self‑promotion.

Time zones and calendar load make inclusion costly, so make yourself easy to invite. Work asynchronously by default, cut down meeting length, and offer flexible ways to collaborate. If you become someone who lightens the load instead of adding to it, you'll find more rooms opening up.

Once you're there, don't overstay your welcome. Being in the room is about adding value, not just occupying a slot on a Zoom grid. Make your points, clarify next steps, and often underrated summarise decisions afterwards so things don't get lost in the shuffle.

Getting in the room, especially in a remote company, isn't about chasing visibility for its own sake. It's about making sure your effort actually moves the needle, for you and for your team. That comes down to intent, preparation, and a reputation for bringing clarity where things are murky.
