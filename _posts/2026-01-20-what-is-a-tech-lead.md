> This post is part of my [Tech Lead Series](/tags/tech-lead-series), a collection of practical advice for engineers stepping into leadership roles.

Three weeks into my first tech lead role, my manager asked how things were going. I told her I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing. She laughed and said, "Neither does anyone else."

I'd spent those three weeks bouncing between writing code, reviewing PRs, sitting in planning meetings, having 1:1s with engineers I'd been peers with days earlier, and trying to figure out why the deployment pipeline kept failing on Thursdays. Nobody had given me a job description. The promotion announcement just said "tech lead" and left me to work out the rest.

The role is different everywhere, defined by context rather than a career ladder document.

## The Role Nobody Defines

Ask ten companies what a tech lead does and you'll get twelve answers.

At large tech companies, the role often means "senior IC who sets technical direction." No people management. No delivery responsibility. Just architecture, code quality, and mentoring. These companies have separate engineering managers handling the people side.

Most companies aren't like this. They don't have the headcount to split technical leadership from people leadership. They need someone who can do both.

At a typical mid-sized company, the tech lead is responsible for the technical direction of the team AND helping people grow AND making sure things ship. You're in the architecture meetings and the 1:1s. You're reviewing the RFC and coaching the junior developer. You're debugging the production issue at 6pm and explaining to the PM why the timeline slipped.

This isn't a failure of organisation design. It's just how smaller teams work. You can't specialise when there are only 30 engineers in the company.

## Three Core Responsibilities

The hybrid tech lead role breaks down into three areas that overlap constantly.

Technical direction means you're responsible for the architecture decisions that shape how the team builds software. Not making every decision yourself, but making sure the team makes good ones. This means setting quality standards, managing technical debt on purpose rather than by accident, and knowing when to push back on shortcuts.

Team growth means helping engineers get better at their jobs. This happens through code reviews, pairing sessions, and 1:1 conversations. It also happens through the less visible work: sharing context about why decisions were made, explaining the business problem behind the ticket, connecting people with the right opportunities.

Delivery means things need to ship. You're the person who notices when a project is drifting, who has the difficult conversation about scope, who unblocks the team when they're stuck. You're not a project manager, but you're responsible for making sure the team delivers.

These three responsibilities pull in different directions. Time spent on architecture is time not spent coaching. Time spent unblocking delivery is time not spent writing code. Learning to balance them is the actual job. (I've written before about these tensions in [four pillars of engineering leadership](/four-pillars-of-engineering-leadership).)

## What a Tech Lead is NOT

The title confuses people, including the people who hold it.

A tech lead is not a senior developer with a new title. If you're still spending 80% of your time writing code, you're a senior developer. The tech lead role requires spending real time on the non-coding parts: mentoring, planning, communicating, decision-making.

A tech lead is not a mini engineering manager. You probably have some people responsibilities, but you're not running performance reviews or handling compensation. You're focused on the technical growth and day-to-day support of your team.

A tech lead is not the person who writes all the important code. Your job is to make the team capable of writing important code, not to hoard the interesting problems for yourself.

## The Multiplier Test

The best measure I've found for whether you're doing the role well: is the team depending less on you each month?

Your goal is to make yourself less necessary over time. When you join a team, they might need you for every architecture decision. Six months later, they should be making good decisions without you in the room. When you start, junior engineers might need your help debugging. Later, they should be teaching others what you taught them.

This feels backwards. Don't you want to be essential? No. Essential people are bottlenecks. If everything requires your input, the team can only move as fast as your calendar allows.

The best tech leads work themselves out of their current job so they can take on new challenges. They leave behind teams that are better than when they arrived. This is the essence of [doing leveraged work](/doing-leveraged-work): efforts that multiply what teams can achieve long after you've moved on.

## This Series

This is the first post in a series about the tech lead role. Not the version with dedicated career ladders and clear boundaries. The version where you're figuring it out as you go, balancing technical leadership with people work, shipping features while growing a team.

The posts that follow will cover the practical challenges: working with PMs and designers, running effective 1:1s, balancing coding and leading, giving hard feedback, and the rest of what nobody tells you when you get the title.
