Something I struggle with most is switching between ground-level details and the bigger picture. The shift from "in the weeds" problem-solving to true systems thinking is never as clean as it looks in management diagrams. Most days, it feels less like climbing a ladder and more like running up a down escalator; just when you think you're operating at the right altitude, something drags you back to the ground.

This is where the *Flight Levels* framework has been especially useful as a mental model. [Flight Levels: Leading Organizations with Business Agility](https://www.flightlevels.io/book) by Klaus Leopold, describes three core "flight levels" in an organisation:

> "It's not about getting everyone to 30,000 feet. It's about knowing which altitude you're at, why you're there, and when it's time to change."

At the **first flight level**, you're inside the team, working on stories, fixing bugs, running stand-ups. It's the realm of the day-to-day, where things are concrete and feedback loops are tight. It's deeply satisfying because you can see and touch the work.

The **second flight level** zooms out: now you're looking across teams, surfacing dependencies, bottlenecks, and hand-offs. The game shifts from "how do we ship this feature?" to "how do we keep the whole machine running smoothly?"

**Flight Level Three** is the true balcony view: systems thinking, business outcomes, portfolio management. It's no longer about work-in-progress tickets or Jira boards. It's about how the whole organisation adapts to change, allocates resources, and stays focused on outcomes.

## Gravity Always Wins

The challenge, at least for me, is that gravity is always pulling you back to level one. Every fire, incident, or awkward hand-off tempts you to jump in and fix things directly. As an engineer, this feels like helping. As a leader, it's often the opposite: you end up treating symptoms, not causes. If you spend all your energy in the weeds, nobody's looking at the system as a whole.

I've found the only way to get better at operating at the right flight level is to build habits that *force* you to look up. These might be as simple as carving out time each week to review key delivery metrics like cycle time, cross-team blockers, or where work is piling up. Even just asking "are we working on the right thing?" before diving into the next fire.

But the real unlocking is reframing the job: leadership isn't just about helping your team *do* the work, it's about working *on* the system that produces the work. That means:

- **Stepping back regularly:** Use rituals (weekly reviews, retros) to force altitude changes.
- **[Surfacing hidden constraints](/optimising-teams-with-theory-of-constraints):** Map dependencies, bottlenecks, and work hand-offs.
- **Making goals explicit:** The higher up you go, the fuzzier alignment gets, so over-communicate why and what, not just how.
- **Resisting the urge to rescue:** When you feel yourself about to jump into ticket triage, ask if you're solving a one-off or treating a pattern.

## Flight Levels as a Practice

I'm still not perfect at this, but I'm trying to get more deliberate about where I spend my time and which flight level I'm operating at.

*Flight Levels* is a practical reminder: you don't need to stay at 30,000 feet all day. You should know why you're there, what needs your attention, and when it's time to come back down.

The real trick, and maybe the hardest part of leadership, is making sure you're working on the team, not just in it.
