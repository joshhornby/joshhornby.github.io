description: "Years ago, a previous manager laid out what he called the four pillars of engineering leadership. I keep returning to them because they're straightforward, but never simplistic. They remind me that leadership isn't about hierarchy or authority, it's about how you shape and connect the parts that make a team strong. Each pillar builds on the last; miss one, and the whole structure loses its balance."

A few years ago a previous manager Paul Ingham laid out what he called the four pillars of engineering leadership. They remind me that leadership isn't about hierarchy or authority, it's about how you shape and connect the parts that make a team strong. Each pillar builds on the last.

## Engineering Artisanship

It starts with the craft. Artisanship is the pursuit of writing quality code that's understandable, building systems you'd be proud to own in a year, and fixing things properly, not just quickly.

This is the foundation. If you can't model mastery, you can't expect it from your team. Your standards flow into every decision, what gets merged, what gets reworked, what you quietly let through.

Without artisanship, the rest is theory.

## Engineering Strategy

Once you've built your craft, you earn the right to look up to set a direction. Strategy is the layer that gives meaning to the daily work. It's not just picking goals, it's the discipline to connect the work to something larger.
Here's where you move from "doing things well" to "doing the right things, well".

But you can't do this credibly without a foundation of artisanship otherwise, strategy is just a wish list.

## Culture

Culture builds on both craft and strategy. It's how the team moves from "a group of skilled individuals" to "a group who achieve together". 

You need a culture where feedback flows, candour is normal, and standards are shared.
This isn't an accident; it's the result of a thousand small choices, what you reward, what you tolerate, how you act when things go wrong.

Culture makes the hard bits possible: it's the flywheel that turns good strategy and strong craft into consistent momentum.

## Stakeholder Engagement

Everything up to this point is wasted if it doesn't connect outward. Stakeholder engagement is the final layer, the outward face of engineering. It's not just communicating status updates; it's drawing in product, design, ops, and sometimes even users, so you're solving the right problems together.

It relies on the other pillars: without strong culture, collaboration falls flat; without a clear strategy, your conversations go in circles; without real craft, you lose trust.

Stakeholder engagement is where you make the invisible visible and where engineering actually matters.

Each pillar supports the next. Skip one and quality suffers, priorities drift, teams disengage, and engineering becomes a silo. But stack them deliberately, and you build something resilient.
