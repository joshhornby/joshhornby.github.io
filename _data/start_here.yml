intro: "I'm a Principal Engineer writing about engineering leadership, systems thinking, and building effective teams. Most of what I write comes directly from the work: patterns I've spotted across companies, failures I've learned from, and frameworks that have actually helped."

sections:
  - title: Engineering Leadership
    description: What it takes to lead engineering teams well, from craft to culture.

        title: Optimising Teams with Theory of Constraints
        summary: One bottleneck controls your entire throughput, not the sum of everyone's effort.

  - title: Product Engineering & Delivery
    description: Building the right thing, not just building the thing right.
    posts:
      - url: /product-engineers
        title: Product Engineers
        summary: Engineers who care more about whether something works for customers than whether it ships on time.
      - url: /cycle-time-not-north-star
        title: Cycle Time is Not a North Star
        summary: Delivery metrics are useful, but they're not the goal.
